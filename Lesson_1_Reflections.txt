// finding the difference between two versions 
// of files are done as follow:
FC filename1 filename2 // for windows
diff -u filename1 filename2 // for Mac and Linux

// It was helpful because it makes comparison of 
// files easier using simple codes!

// How could having easy access to the entire 
// history of a file make you a more efficient 
// programmer in the long term?

// It gives me a view of what I have done
// in the past that worked and which that
// didn't.
// I will be able to see the frequency of
// my mistakes and how can I improve and not
// do it again

// What do you think are the pros and cons of manually 
// choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
// vs having versions automatically saved, like Google 
// Docs does?

// It will be troublesome if you forget to commit things
// It will be efficient if done correctly.

// Why do you think some version control systems,
// like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
// while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

// It depends on the application of the version control,
// Git was trageted to programming code hence there was a
// need to employ multiple files in one commit.

// How can you use the commands git log
// and git diff to view the history of files?

// git log will give you a hisory of the commits
// and corresponding description while git diff
// will identify the lines changed by those commits

// How might using version control make you
// more confident to make changes that could
// break something?

// It gives me freedom to go experiment and
// edit my codes

// Now that you have your workspace
// set up, what do you want to try
// using Git for?

// Android App codes, etc.
