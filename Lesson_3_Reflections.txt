// When would you want to use a remote
// repository rather than keeping all your work local?

// If you are working on multiple location
// or workstatsions.

// Why might you want to always pull changes manually
// rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
// with your remote repository?

// It gives you flexibility

// Describe the differences between forks, clones,
// and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

// Forks are clones in GitHub. Clones maybe done between GitHub
// and Local or within Local. Branches are current copies of the
// Master or any existing Branch.

// What is the benefit of having a copy of
// the last known state of the remote stored locally?

// Flexibility

// How would you collaborate without using Git
// or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

// Email, Lync or phone call.
